---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Query → Analyze Intent → Rank Context Pieces → Select Top N → Send to LLM
```

### Core Components

1. **Context Chunker**: Breaks large content into manageable pieces (fixed-size, semantic, sliding window)
2. **Relevance Ranker**: Scores chunks using embeddings, keywords, recency, and relationships
3. **Context Selector**: Picks optimal chunks within token budget using various strategies
4. **Vector Store**: ChromaDB for fast similarity search (optional)
5. **Cache Layer**: In-memory caching for performance

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd tokenwise

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

Required configuration:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

The API will start at `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Test It Out

Run the basic example:

```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

## 📖 API Usage

### Optimize Context

**Endpoint**: `POST /optimize`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "How does authentication work?",
  "context": [
    {
      "id": "file1",
      "text": "Your content here...",
      "type": "code"
    }
  ],
  "targetTokens": 4000,
  "options": {
    "strategy": "diversity",
    "includeMetadata": true,
    "preserveOrder": false,
    "minRelevanceScore": 0.3,
    "diversityLambda": 0.5
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "optimized_context": [
    {
      "id": "chunk_1",
      "text": "Relevant content...",
      "relevance_score": 0.89,
      "reason": "High semantic similarity + keywords match",
      "source": "file1"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "original_tokens": 50000,
    "optimized_tokens": 3847,
    "reduction_percent": 92.3,
    "estimated_savings_usd": 2.41,
    "processing_time_ms": 387,
    "chunks_analyzed": 45,
    "chunks_selected": 8
  }
}
```

### Index Content (Optional)

Pre-index content for faster future queries:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/index \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "my_document",
    "text": "Content to index...",
    "type": "docs"
  }'
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Statistics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
```

---

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Python Usage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/optimize",
    json={
        "query": "How do I authenticate users?",
        "context": [
            {"id": "auth", "text": "...", "type": "code"}
        ],
        "targetTokens": 2000
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Reduced tokens by {result['stats']['reduction_percent']}%")
```

### With Different Strategies

#### Top-N Selection (Fastest)
```python
options = {"strategy": "top-n"}
```
Simply takes the highest-scoring chunks. Fast but may miss diversity.

#### Diversity Selection (Recommended)
```python
options = {
    "strategy": "diversity",
    "diversityLambda": 0.5  # Balance relevance (1.0) vs diversity (0.0)
}
```
Uses Maximal Marginal Relevance to ensure variety in selected chunks.

#### Dependency-Aware (Best for Code)
```python
options = {"strategy": "dependency"}
```
Includes related chunks (e.g., functions that call each other).

## 📊 Benchmark Results

Real-world performance test with authentication codebase (GPT-3.5-turbo):

| Metric | Before TokenWise | After TokenWise | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Tokens** | 459 | 155 | **66.2% reduction** |
| **Cost per query** | $0.001288 | $0.000772 | **$0.000516 saved (40%)** |
| **Processing time** | 5.1s | 8.7s | +3.5s optimization overhead |

### Cost Savings at Scale

| Queries/Month | Before | After | **Monthly Savings** |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 10,000 | $12.88 | $7.72 | **$5.16** |
| 100,000 | $128.80 | $77.20 | **$51.60** |
| 1,000,000 | $1,288 | $772 | **$516** |

**Query:** "How does user authentication and login work?"  
**Context:** 5 files (auth, database, payment, email, analytics)  
**Selected:** Only authentication-related code (1 file)  
**Ignored:** Payment, email, analytics modules (irrelevant)

### What This Means

- ✅ **66% fewer tokens** sent to your LLM
- ✅ **Same or better answer quality** (focused on relevant code)
- ✅ **Automatic filtering** of irrelevant context
- ✅ **$516/month saved** at 1M queries (typical enterprise scale)
- ⚡ **Run benchmark:** `python run_benchmark.py` (requires OpenAI API key)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB
- **Caching**: In-memory (Redis-ready)
- **Token Counting**: tiktoken

---

## 📐 How It Works

### 1. Chunking
Content is split into chunks using:
- **Fixed-size**: Every N tokens
- **Semantic**: At logical boundaries (functions, paragraphs)
- **Sliding window**: Overlapping chunks for continuity

### 2. Ranking
Each chunk is scored using:

**Embedding Similarity (50%)**: Semantic similarity to query  
**Keyword Matching (20%)**: Keyword overlap  
**Recency (15%)**: Newer content scores higher  
**Relationships (10%)**: Connected chunks are boosted  
**LLM Scoring (5%)**: Optional deep analysis

### 3. Selection
Chunks are selected using:

**Top-N**: Simple, fast, take highest scores  
**Diversity (MMR)**: Balance relevance with variety  
**Dependency**: Include related chunks

### 4. Assembly
Selected chunks are:
- Reordered logically (by source, position)
- Formatted with metadata
- Returned with statistics

---

## 💰 Cost Savings Example

**Before TokenWise:**
- 100K tokens per query
- 1,000 queries/day
- Cost: $3/1M tokens
- **Daily cost: $300**

**After TokenWise:**
- 10K tokens per query (90% reduction)
- 1,000 queries/day
- Cost: $3/1M tokens
- **Daily cost: $30**

**Savings: $270/day = $8,100/month**

## 🎯 Optimization Strategies

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **top-n** | Simple queries, speed priority | Fastest, most relevant | May lack diversity |
| **diversity** | Complex queries, broad topics | Balanced coverage | Slightly slower |
| **dependency** | Code analysis, interconnected data | Complete context | May include less relevant items |

### Tuning Parameters

**targetTokens**: Adjust based on your LLM's context window
- GPT-3.5: 4,000-8,000 tokens
- GPT-4: 8,000-16,000 tokens
- Claude: 4,000-8,000 tokens

**minRelevanceScore**: Filter out low-relevance chunks
- Strict: 0.5-0.7
- Moderate: 0.3-0.5
- Permissive: 0.1-0.3

**diversityLambda**: Balance relevance vs diversity (for diversity strategy)
- High relevance: 0.7-1.0
- Balanced: 0.4-0.6
- High diversity: 0.0-0.3

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` file

### "Could not connect to TokenWise API"
- Make sure server is running: `python main.py`
- Check port 8000 is not in use

### Slow performance
- Pre-index large content with `/index` endpoint
- Reduce `target_tokens` budget
- Use "top-n" strategy instead of "diversity"
- Enable Redis for distributed caching

### Low quality results
- Increase `target_tokens` budget
- Lower `minRelevanceScore` threshold
- Try "diversity" strategy
- Check if content is properly chunked
